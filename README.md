Frontend for Bee Twogether: Helping Couples Collaborate

## Archival Notes
This app is not usable, but it is useful to me to understand why I started it
and why I abandoned it, so that I hopefully I can focus future impact.

### Starting Goal
Many years into my relationship with my now-wife, I was looking for ways to
keep track of her hectic and somewhat unpredictable work schedule, as well as
coordinate with her over a bunch of little details.
I figured other couples might have similar annoyances and want a bunch of
coordination tools consolidated into one app.

### Abandonment
I still think this app idea is pretty good, but I'm not passionate about it.
I've picked up some habits (and dropped others) that have led to me being able
to coordinate more effectively with my partner. Sometimes the best solution
isn't code.

Overall I'm happier about this idea, how this project went,
and how it ended compared to
other projects I've abandoned in the past (like
[DnD5EHelper](https://github.com/joneiros/DnD5EHelper)), but it still
didn't get very far:
- hosted temporarily on Github Pages, but really only a landing page.
- Backend repo deleted as there was essentially nothing to show.

I'll come back to this if I don't have any other ideas to work on, but I
expect there will always be something more interesting that will stop me
coming back to this project.
